# locked-phone

Hi, i'm new on this website so i'm sorry if i'm doing something wrong.

I have a old phone (Samsung j5 2016) whose pin I can't remember to unlock it and i would like at least to recover photo and data in it.
The phone has not a custom recovery and it is no rooted.
I have tried everything, software like dr.Phone or using the ADB and Fastboot, but the main problem is that the USB debugging is not activated so it doesn't let me do anything.

I would be really happy if someone could at least help me to recover the data, or even more so to unlock the phone.
Thanks
